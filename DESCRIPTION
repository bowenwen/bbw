    for use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either 
    prior weighting (e.g. population-proportional sampling or PPS as used in 
    Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions or SMART 
    surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as used in rapid assessment method or
    RAM and simpe spatial sampling method or S3M surveys). The method was 
    developed by Accion Contra la Faim, Brixton Health, Concern Worldwide,

    Control (CDC) using infant and young child feeding (IYCF) data.
