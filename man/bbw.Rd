\title{Blocked Weighted Bootstrap}
\description{
The \code{blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW)} is an estimation technique for
use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either prior
weighting (e.g. \code{population proportional sampling} or \code{PPS} as
used in \code{SMART} surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as used in
\code{RAM} and \code{S3M} surveys). The method was developed by ACF,
Brixton Health, CONCERN, GAIN, UNICEF (Sierra Leone), UNICEF (Sudan) and
Valid International. It has been tested by CDC using IYCF data.

\details{
The bootstrap technique is summarised in this
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)}{article}.
The \code{BBW} used in \code{RAM} and \code{S3M} is a modification to the
percentile bootstrap to include \code{blocking} and \code{weighting} to
account for a complex sample design.

With \code{RAM} and \code{S3M} surveys, the sample is complex in the sense
that it is an unweighted cluster sample. Data analysis procedures need to
account for the sample design. A \code{blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW)}
can be used:
\describe{
\item{\code{Blocked}}{The block corresponds to the primary sampling unit
(\code{PSU = cluster}). \code{PSUs} are resampled with replacement.
Observations within the resampled \code{PSUs} are also sampled with
replacement.}

\item{\code{Weighted}}{\code{RAM} and \code{S3M} samples do not use
\code{population proportional sampling (PPS)} to weight the sample prior to
data collection (e.g. as is done with \code{SMART} surveys). This means that
a posterior weighting procedure is required. \code{BBW} uses a
\code{"roulette wheel"} algorithm to weight (i.e. by population) the
selection probability of \code{PSUs} in bootstrap replicates.}
}

In the case of prior weighting by \code{PPS} all clusters are given the
same weight. With posterior weighting (as in \code{RAM} or \code{S3M})
the weight is the population of each \code{PSU}. This procedure is very
similar to the \code{fitness proportional selection} technique used in
evolutionary computing.

A total of \emph{m} \code{PSUs} are sampled with replacement for each
bootstrap replicate (where \emph{m} is the number of \code{PSUs} in the survey
sample).

The required statistic is applied to each replicate. The reported estimate
consists of the \code{0.025th (95\% LCL)}, \code{0.5th (point estimate)}, and
\code{0.975th (95\% UCL)} quantiles of the distribution of the statistic across
all survey replicates.

Early versions of the \code{BBW} did not resample observations within
\code{PSUs} following:

inference with clustered errors, Review of Economics and Statistics,
2008:90;414â€“427

and used a large number (e.g. 3999) survey replicates. Current versions of
the \code{BBW} resample observations within \code{PSUs} and use a smaller
number of survey replicates (e.g. n = 400). This is a more computationally
efficient approach
